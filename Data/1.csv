13,"4. If a1, a2, a3 are attributes in a relation and S is another relation, which of the following is an incorrect specification of an integrity constraint?
a)	primary key(a1, a2, a3)
b)	primary key(a1)
c)	foreign key(a1, a2) references S
d)	foreign key(a1, a2)
View Answer","Answer: d

Choose the correct option regarding the above statement
a)	The statement is syntactically wrong
b)	It creates a relation with three attributes ownerID, ownername, floor in which floor cannot be null.
c)	It creates a relation with three attributes ownerID, ownername, floor in which ownerID cannot be null.
d)	It creates a relation with three attributes ownerID, ownername, floor in which ownername must consist of at least 25 characters.
View Answer","Answer: c
Explanation: It creates a relation apartment with three attributes as specified. The attribute ownername cannot be null because it is the primary key of the relation."
19,"10. What does the notnull integrity constraint do?
a)	It ensures that at least one tuple is present in the relation
b)	It ensures that at least one foreign key is present in the relation
c)	It ensures that all tuples have a finite value on a specified attribute
d)	It ensures that all tuples have finite attributes on all the relations
View Answer","Answer: c
Explanation: The notnull integrity constraint ensures that all the tuples have a finite value on the specified attribute in the relation. It avoids the specification of null values."

a)	select <relation> from <attribute>
b)	select <attribute> from <elation>
c)	select <tuple> from <relation>
d)	select <tuple> from <attribute>

a)	and
b)	or
c)	nor
d)	not
View Answer","Answer: d
Explanation: “not” is not a logical connective included in the SQL. The and, or and nor are logical connectives that are included in SQL. "

a)	select
b)	from
c)	with
d)	none of the mentioned
View Answer","Answer: b
Explanation: The “from” clause contains the attribute names on which the “which” clause can be used on. "
24,"5.	select distinct dept_name
from institute;","Answer: b
Explanation: The distinct keyword is used to explicitly force the elimination of duplicate tuples. Thus, the above query excludes duplicates. "
25,"6.	What does the following query do?
select name, ID, branch
from student, department
where student.branch = department.branch;
a)	It gives all values of name, ID, branch from both the relations only if all those attributes are present in both
b)	It gives all values of name, ID, branch from their respective relations
c)	It gives the values of name, ID, branch from their respective relations where the values in the branch attribute are same
d)	It gives the values of name, ID, branch from their respective relations where all the values are matching with each other
View Answer","Answer: c
Explanation: student.branch = department.branch verifies whether both the values of the attributes are same in both the relations and returns the value. "
26,"7.	The ________ clause is used to list the attributes desired in the result of a query
a)	select
b)	from
c)	where

a)	The natural join of both the relations
b)	The left outer join of both the relations
c)	A syntactical error
d)	The Cartesian product of both the relations
View Answer","Answer: d
Explanation: If we specify multiple relations in the from clause and do not specify any conditions in the where clause, the default definition given by the from clause is the Cartesian product of the relations listed in the clause. So it returns all the possible combinations of the tuples of the two relations. "
28,"9.	State true or false: Multiple conditions in the where clause are separated by a “,”
a)	True
b)	False
View Answer","Answer: b
Explanation: Multiple conditions in the where clause are separated by the “and” keyword. "
29,"10.	What does the natural join operation do?

b)	It considers only those pairs of tuples that have the same value on at least one of the attributes that appear in the schemas of both the relations
c)	It considers only those pairs of tuples that do not have the same value on those attributes that appear in the schemas of both relations
d)	None of the mentioned
View Answer","Answer: a
Explanation: The natural join operation considers only those pairs of tuples that have the same value on those attributes that appear in the schemas of both the relations. The natural join operation operates on 2 relations and gives a relation as the result. "
30,"11.	Observe the following query and choose the correct option.
select name, ID
from student natural join department natural join section
a)	The query is syntactically wrong because there is no where clause
b)	The query is syntactically wrong because there are more than one attributes in the select clause
c)	The query is syntactically wrong because more than one relations are included in the natural join operation
d)	The query is correct
View Answer","Answer: d
Explanation: The query is syntactically correct because, where clause is not necessary in a query, more than one attributes can be specified in the select clause and more than one relations may be operated on, using the natural join operator. "
31,"12. Which keyword is used to rename a relation in a query?
a)	rename
b)	as
c)	is
d)	to
View Answer","Answer: b
Explanation: The “as” keyword is used to rename a relation in a query. This is used for convenience as long relation names can reduce readability. "

a)	A string of three letters
b)	A string of at least three letters
c)	A string of three words
d)	A string of at least three words

View Answer","Answer: b
Explanation: The intersect operation returns the intersection of the results of the results of two different queries which have the same set of attributes in the select clause. It automatically eliminates duplicates. "
35,"3.	What is the function of the except operation?
a)	It excludes all the results present in both the queries
b)	It includes the results of the second query but excludes the results of the first query
c)	It includes the results of the first query but excludes the results of the second query
d)	It includes all the results of both queries but removes duplicates
View Answer","Answer: c
Explanation: The except operation includes the results of the first query but excludes the results of the second query. It automatically eliminates duplicates but if we want to retain duplicates we must use except all in place of except. "
36,"4.	When does the predicate is null succeed?
a)	If the value on which it is applied is finite
b)	If the value on which it is applied is invalid
c)	If the value on which it is applied is blank

38,"6.	Observe the following query and choose the correct optiona)	The query is syntactically wrong
b)	The query gives all the possible student names where a finite value exists for ID
c)	The query gives the names of the students that have a null ID and it also excludes identical names
d)	The query gives the student names where a finite value exists for ID and it excludes identical names
View Answer","Answer: d
Explanation: The distinct keyword is used to remove tuples that have identical values. The is not null clause checks only for ID’s that are not null values. "
39,"7.	What will be the result of the following query?a)	All the values of the studentid for which section is c and roll < 10
b)	All the values of the studentid for which section is c and roll > 10
c)	All the values of the studentid for which section not c and roll < 10
d)	All the values of the studentid for which section not c and roll > 10
View Answer","Answer: b
Explanation: The except operation excludes all the tuples that are present in the result of the second query from the result of the first query. It also excludes all duplicates from the relation. "
40,"8.	Which of the following correctly describes the between predicate in the where clause?
a)	It is used to check whether a value is in between two specified values
b)	It is used to check whether a value is exactly in the center of the relation alphabetically
c)	It is used to check whether a value is in between any two other values in the database
d)	None of the mentioned
View Answer","Answer: a
Explanation: The between predicate in the where clause is used to check whether a value is in between two externally specified values. This clause is used to list out all tuples having a value within a range. "
41,"1.	Which of the following is not a built in aggregate function in SQL?
a)	avg
b)	max
c)	total
d)	count
View Answer","Answer: c
