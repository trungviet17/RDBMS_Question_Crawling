a) Higher-level lock
b) Lower-level lock
c) Read only lock
d) Read write
View Answer","Answer: a
Explanation: Operations acquire lower-level locks while they execute, but release them when they complete; the corresponding transaction must however retain a higher-level lock in a two-phase manner to prevent concurrent transactions from executing conflicting actions."

b) Breakpoints
c) Redo points
d) Checkpoints
View Answer","Answer: d
Explanation: If the log at the remote backup grows large, recovery will take a long time. The remote backup site can periodically process the redo log records that it has received and can perform a checkpoint, so that earlier parts of the log can be deleted."
66,"7. A _______________ configuration can make takeover by the backup site almost instantaneous.
a) Hot-spare
b) Remote
