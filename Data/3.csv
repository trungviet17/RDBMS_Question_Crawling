The database system can verify the authenticity of the user by decrypting the string with the same secret password and checking the result with the original challenge string. "
458,"8.  Assymmetric Encryption: Why can a message encrypted with the Public Key only be decrypted with the receiver’s appropriate Private Key?
a) Not true, the message can also be decrypted with the Public Key
b) A so called “one way function with back door” is applied for the encryption
c) The Public Key contains a special function which is used to encrypt the message and which can only be reversed by the appropriate Private Key
d) The encrypted message contains the function for decryption which identifies the Private Key
View Answer"," Answer: b
Explanation: An one-way function is a function which a computer can calculate quickly, but whose reversal would last months or years. An one-way function with back door can be reversed with the help of a couple of additional information (the back door), but scarcely without this information. The information for the back door is contained in the private Key. "
459,"9. Which is the largest disadvantage of symmetric Encryption?
a) More complex and therefore more time-consuming calculations
b) Problem of the secure transmission of the Secret Key
c) Less secure encryption function
d) Isn’t used any more
View Answer"," Answer: b
Explanation: As there is only one key in the symmetrical encryption, this must be known by both sender and recipient and this key is sufficient to decrypt the secret message. Therefore it must be exchanged between sender and receiver in such a manner that an unauthorized person can in no case take possession of it. "
460,"10. Which is the principle of the encryption using a key?
a) The key indicates which function is used for encryption. Thereby it is more difficult to decrypt an intercepted message as the function is unknown
b) The key contains the secret function for encryption including parameters. Only a password can activate the key
c) All functions are public, only the key is secret. It contains the parameters used for the encryption resp. decryption
d) The key prevents the user of having to reinstall the software at each change in technology or in the functions for encryption
View AnswerSanfoundry Global Education & Learning Series – Database Management System."," Answer: b
Explanation: The encoding of a message is calculated by an algorithm. If always the same algorithm would be used, it would be easy to crack intercepted messages. However, it isn’t possible to invent a new algorithm whenever the old one was cracked, therefore the possibility to parameterize algorithms is needed and this is the assignment of the key. "

b) 2NF
c) 3NF
d) None of the mentioned
View Answer","Answer: a
Explanation: Since the primary key is not given we have to derive the primary key of the table. Using the closure set of attributes we get the primary key as (F1,F2). From functional dependencies, “F1->F3, F2->F4”, we can see that there is partial functional dependency therefore it is not in 1NF. Hence the table is in 1NF."

View Answer","Answer: d
Explanation: For the given relation only some of the above FDs are applicable. The applicable FDs are given below:

Name->Roll_number
Roll_number->Name
Finding the closure set of attributes we get the candidate keys:(Roll_number,Date_of_Birth), and (Name,Date_of_Birth) .
On selecting any one of the candidate key we can see that the FD Date_of_Birth->Age is a partial dependency. Hence the relation is in 1NF."

a) 1NF only
b) 2NF and hence also in 1NF
c) 3NF and hence also in 2NF and 1NF
d) BCNF and hence also in 3NF, 2NF and 1NF
View Answer","Answer: b
Explanation: Empcode is unique, therefore it is the primary key. Since the primary key consists of a single attribute there will be no partial dependency, hence the relation is in 2NF.
From the question we get the FDs as below:
 pincode -> city, state
 street,city,state -> pincode
From the FDs we can see that there are transitive dependencies, hence the table is not in 3NF."
