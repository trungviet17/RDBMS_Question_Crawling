a)	Read uncommitted
b)	Serializable
c)	Repeatable read
d)	Read committed
View Answer","Answer: c
Explanation: Repeatable read allows only committed data to be read and further requires that no other transaction is allowed to update it between two reads of a data item by a transaction. However, the transaction may not be serializable with respect to other transactions."

a)	True
b)	False
View Answer","Answer: a
Explanation: It is not necessarily desirable for a transaction to unlock a data item immediately after its final access because serializability may be violated due to this. "

24,"4.	State true or false: Wait die scheme is a non-preemptive technique
a)	True
b)	False
View Answer","Answer: a
Explanation: The wait-die scheme is a non-preemptive technique. When transaction Ti requests a data item currently held by Tj , Ti is allowed to wait only if it has a timestamp smaller than that of Tj (that is, Ti is older than Tj ). Otherwise, Ti is rolled back (dies)."
25,"5.	Lock timeouts have which of the following advantages?
a)	Unnecessary rollbacks do not occur
b)	Transactions do not starve
c)	It is easy to implement
d)	All of the mentioned
View Answer","Answer: d

a)	Avoiding starvation
b)	Number of transactions involved in rollback
c)	Data items used by the transaction
d)	All of the mentioned

35,"6.	The default timestamp ordering protocol generates schedules that are
a)	Recoverable
b)	Non-recoverable
c)	Starving
d)	None of the mentioned
View Answer","Answer: b
Explanation: The timestamp ordering protocol generates schedules that are non-recoverable. But it can be extended to make the schedules recoverable."

a)	True
b)	False
View Answer","Answer: a
Explanation: The Thomas write rule has a greater potential concurrency than the timestamp ordering protocol. This is because it is a modified version of the timestamp ordering protocol in which obsolete write operations can be ignored under certain circumstances."

a)	Thomas write rule
b)	Timestamp ordering protocol
c)	Validation protocol
d)	None of the mentioned
View Answer","Answer: a
Explanation: Thomas write rule protocol generates serializable schedules that no other protocol can generate."

a)	Read operation is executed
b)	Read operation is rejected
c)	Write operation is executed
d)	Write operation is rejected
View Answer","Answer: b
Explanation: Suppose that transaction Ti issues read(Q). If TS(Ti ) < W-timestamp(Q), then Ti needs to read a value of Q that was already overwritten. Hence, the read operation is rejected, and Ti is rolled back."
39,"10.	In timestamp ordering protocol, suppose that the transaction Ti issues write(Q) and TS(Ti)<W-timestamp(Q), then
a)	Read operation is executed
b)	Read operation is rejected
c)	Write operation is executed
d)	Write operation is rejected
View Answer","Answer: d
Explanation: In timestamp ordering protocol, suppose that the transaction Ti issues write(Q) and TS(Ti)<W-timestamp(Q), then the value of Q that Ti is producing was needed previously, and the system assumed that the value would never be produced. Hence the system rejects the write(Q) operation and the transaction Ti rolls back."

a)	Validation protocol
b)	Timestamp protocol
c)	Deadlock protocol
d)	View protocol
View Answer","Answer: a

a)	Read phase
b)	Validation phase
c)	Write phase
d)	None of the mentioned
View Answer","Answer: a

42,"3.	During the _________ phase the validation test is applied to the transaction
a)	Read phase
b)	Validation phase
c)	Write phase
d)	None of the mentioned

a)	Read phase
b)	Validation phase
c)	Write phase
d)	None of the mentioned

44,"5.	Read only operations omit the _______ phase
a)	Read phase
b)	Validation phase
c)	Write phase
d)	None of the mentioned
View Answer","Answer: c
Explanation: Read only operations do not allow write operation to be performed on them. So, they omit the write phase but execute the read and validation phases. "

51,"2.	If the first update is overwritten by a second, it is called as a _______ update
a)	Useful
b)	Overlapping
c)	Lost
d)	Concurrent

a)	Multiversion scheme
b)	Timestamp protocol
c)	Lock based protocol
d)	Snapshot isolation

a)	Halter assumption
b)	Phantom assumption
c)	Fail-stop assumption
d)	Disk failure
View Answer","Answer: c
Explanation: The assumption that the hardware errors bring the system to a halt is called as fail-stop assumption. Well-designed systems have numerous internal checks that bring a system to a halt whenever there is an error. Hence, the fail stop assumption is a reasonable one. "

76,"8.	State true or false: The destination block has incorrect information in case of a total failure
a)	True
b)	False
View Answer","Answer: b
